        <h1>What is Fibonacci Sequence?</h1>
        <p>The Fibonacci sequence, also known as Fibonacci numbers, is defined as <br>the sequence of numbers in which each number in the sequence is equal to the sum of <br>two numbers before it. The Fibonacci Sequence is given as: 
        <br><br>
        Fibonacci Sequence = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc… 
        <br><br>
        Here, the third term “1” is obtained by adding the first and second term. (i.e., 0+1 = 1) 
        <br><br> 
        Similarly, 
        <br><br>
        “2” is obtained by adding the second and third term (1+1 = 2)
        <br><br>
        “3” is obtained by adding the third and fourth term (1+2) and so on.
        <br><br>
        For example, the next term after 21 can be found by adding 13 and 21. Therefore, the <br>next term in the sequence is 34.</p>

        <h2>Fibonacci Sequence Formula</h2>
        <p><b>Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2</b>
            <br><br>
            Fn is term number “n” <br>
            Fn-1 is the previous term (n-1) <br>
            Fn-2 is the term before that (n-2) <br></p>
            <br>
            <p>Note: Please inspect and console to see the list of first 100 terms <br>in the Fibonacci Sequence.</p>
